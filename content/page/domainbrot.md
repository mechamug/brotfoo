title: Domain Colored Mandelbrot
comments: true

The same as a regular Mandelbrot set, but instead of the boring solid color, the same technique as for some domain coloring approaches is used, with a color index being chosen on the interval $[-\pi, \pi]$, scaled to the range of the maximum iterations chosen, i.e. the escape bound.
