A few images generated with the source code from the [EHT black hole imaging project](https://github.com/achael/eht-imaging). Color maps were taken from the [Palettable Python package](https://jiffyclub.github.io/palettable/). I have made some minor modifications to the code, which I felt produced visually more appealing results and allowed me to change some additional parameters of the image display.

There were a few [news articles](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-image-event-horizon-telescope-top-science-stories-2019-yir) circulating about this not too long ago. I found the project very interesting and had played around with the code as soon as it had been released. The pictures that came out of it were sitting on my hard disk, collecting dust, so I thought I might give it a try and share them here. Most of this is not my creation and I hope it doesn't seem to derivative. I just liked the variations of the images that I ended up with. The original authors have by far done the bulk work and I have only made very minor tweaks, such as specification of a custom color map, brightness scaling, interpolation, etc.
